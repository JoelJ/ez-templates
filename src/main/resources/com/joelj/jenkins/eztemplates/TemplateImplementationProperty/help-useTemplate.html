    <p>Allows you to specify another job to use as a template.</p>
    <p>
        The implementation overwrites its config with that of the template <em>except</em> the
        <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Parameterized+Build">parameters</a>,
        which retain their default values, and items covered by specific flags.
    </p>
    <p>
        Synchronisation happens whenever an implementation job or its template is saved.
